# **ToDoListMini**

## _Operating The List_
   This list is a mini-project for school. It is built to be run from the *Command Line*. When the file for this list is open, 
 the user will be prompted to enter a number from the menu for the action they would like to perform. 
   
##  *Welcome to the To-Do List App!*
### **Menu:**

1. Add a task
2. View tasks
3. Mark a task as complete
4. Delete a task
5. Quit

   There are several user input requirements within the Menu, and the functions that are called when you select from numbers 
 1, 3, or 4. *All inputs will be Integers* **EXCEPT** *for the add a task function, which is a regular string input.* If the 
user selects number 5, the program will close out and say a friendly "goodbye". Once the program is closed the user wont be 
able to access that same To-Do list again. The list doesn't store. The empty list will be re-initialized.

## ***Features***
- Clean, easy to read code
- Error/Exception handling
- Friendly command line prompts
- Simple to use
- User input is *not* case sensitive. No need to worry about typing it the exact same as before, everything is converted before it is stored.
